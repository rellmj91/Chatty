**Chatty Web Application**

The main reason of this web application is development, as fresh web developer, I still have lot to learn and that is done by, immersing into the subject at hand, experience. With that being said, changes will be add daily to to web application. I will leave a list of the changes made so you, if you choose, can follow along with the flow and growth of Chatty. 

As I add on to the progress list, I'm completing the task myself as I am completing the task, I'm thinking and adding on more structure/functionality task. This is kind of to just give you an idea of the flow, therefor task are being updated daily.
As you complete these task, keep in mind there are many ways to code these task and as seeing I am not a "Pro" lol, you may find better ways to code these task. Be as creative as you want.

**Phase 1: Structure & Functionality**
For the beginning of this application I wanted to just get a structure in mind, a beginning footprint of how I wanted the application to look, you have to start somewhere, also some basic functionalities. How it looks now will be totally drifferent from the more polished version.

- [] Create the layout, we'll need to start with 2 layouts. 1 for the people currently on the website and 1 for the actual chat display. 

- [] For the chat display, create the functionality of the chat. You should be able to type in multiple message that displays correctly in the chat display.
    * Your chat display should have an text input & button that sends the input.
    * Every sent chat message should display visually list-style.
    * Long chat messages should not extend pass the chat display itself.

- [] For the layout made for people currently online, have it display the users online.
    * Your currently the only users, lets assign you some type of identifier.
    * Display the identifier (a Name, Number, ID, ect.. for the specific user)
    on the layout for the currently online.
    * Now that we have displayed the user identifier, include the users indentifier in the message the user sends to be displayed.
    * Create 2 dummy users, with identifiers, displayed on users online layout.
