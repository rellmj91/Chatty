**Chatty Web Application**
The main reason of this web application is development, as fresh web developer, I still have lots to learn and that is done by, immersing into the subject at hand, experience. With that being said, programming languages I use are, HTML, CSS, Javascript. In my .js file you'll see I use the library jQuery. There are many drifferent approachs to get similar or better results of this coding, so try not to copy do some critical thinking, try drifferent things. As I learn the code will be updated. Mean while, content add ons and progression of the application will continue. Eventually, more libraries, frameworks and servers will be included.

**Here's how this works**
The application will be consistently updated, so make sure you check back to see what task has been added. Task is like a roadmap to what I would like to add to improve the application. So, as I'm completing tasked, I'm thinking about what more can I do to improve. As I add, I update for you guys. Giving you the opportunity to follow along, give feedback, learn & teach, be creative, challenge yourself to grow and to visually see the growth of the application.

**Phase 1: Structure & Functionality**
For the beginning of this application I wanted to just get a structure in mind, a beginning footprint, of how I wanted the application to look. You have to start somewhere. Also, some basic functionalities. How it looks now will be totally drifferent from the more polished version as I advance along in the creation as well as knownledge of web development.

**Chat Box**
- [] First, we will create the layout for out chat display, it doesn't have to be all fancy, yet. Remember this is about structure and functionality. 
    * Create an input for the text to be displayed on chat display.
    * Create an button that gets the text input and displays on chat display when button is clicked.
    * Lets create an alternate way to send our input using the "Enter" key on your keyboard.
    * Your chat display should display visually a block style/list style format.
    * Long messages should not extend outside of the chat display.
    * Your message need to have an identity, create a way that will assign the visiting user an identity. When you refresh your page your identity should change.
    * Display your identity in your message.
Now we should have a simple functioning chat box.

**Visitors**
- [] Next, lets create a layout that will display the users that are currently online.
    * Use the identifier thats we created to be assigned and list it on the user online layout.
    * Create 2 more dummy users with an identity, then display them on the users online layout list.
    * Make each identity on the users online layout clickable, the page should not refresh when clicked. As of now we just want to make sure this is functioning. So, create an alert listing the individual identity. (So if the identity you created is a number, the number should display in the alert. if its a name, the name should display in the alert.)
